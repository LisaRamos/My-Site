          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>I have been working with Adobe products for over ten years until I switched to Affinity products due to the subscription model which makes it difficult to keep up with. Over that amount of time, I have gained experience designing logos, brochures, invitations, flyers, and corporate idenity.</p>
